AnomalyDetection
================

AnomalyDetection is proof-of-concept code that demonstrates the ability to detect anomalies in Multispeak traffic and
tries to suggest possible reasons for the anomalies based on past experiences. The anomaly detection is called the "unsupervised"
component as it operates on unlabeled data. The component that suggests possible reasons for the anomalies is called 
"supervised" because it draws on information previously labeled by an operator. Once the actual cause of an unsupervised
anomaly is known, the user annotates it as such and it becomes a new datapoint for the supervised component.

Anomaly detection can be accomplished using a plethora of algorithms. Each technique has strengths and weaknesses depending
on the nature of the input data. We are currently using Support Vector Machines with a Chi Squared kernel. However
we expect this to change as we gain a better understanding as to the nature of Multispeak traffic.

AnomalyDetection currently interacts with several components. A REST API allows a user to load and manipulate data and 
run tests. There is also code to read Multispeak data from a remote database and interact with Essence to report anomalies
and retrieve information for the supervised decision making.

Once we have enough Multispeak traffic to tune the code, most of the REST interface will be removed and replaced with
a daemon that continually runs a predefined list of tests looking for abnormal behavior.

It should be noted that the word "anomaly" does not imply hostile or adversarial behavior. This project is designed to
detect that traffic patterns are different; it is up to the operator to decide if the alerts are acceptable or require
action.

# Running the daemon
The code is written in Java 7. Most dependencies are installed using Apache Maven. There is one exception:

  * Download the newest version of the library here: https://www.savarese.com/software/libssrckdtree-j/
  * Look for the precompiled jar file in lib/libssrckdtree-j-<version>.jar
  * Install the library into Maven (in this example we'll assume the kdtree library version is 1.0.2. If your version is different, you should make sure the pom.xml file reflects that). Note that the parameter for -Dfile= is the relative path to your jar file
  * mvn install:install-file -Dfile=lib/libssrckdtree-j-1.0.2.jar -DgroupId=com.savarese.spatial -DartifactId=libssrckdtree
-Dversion=1.0.2 -Dpackaging=jar

To start the daemon:
mvn clean; mvn tomcat:run

# Running a test
There are no self-contained tests as this code depends on an external packet database as well as Essence. The Python port attempts to address this issue using artifical data to validate correctness. However the generated data is not a realistic
simulation.

To perform a simple manual exercise, see the file docs/live_demo_outline_jan_2016

# Python port
As the Java code is proof-of-concept and we do not yet know what kinds of Multispeak traffic to expect, the code
 has grown organically and has many shortcomings. We have written a Python port of the code to address
some of the problems and hopefully construct a better foundation for future changes. The REST API is different
in this port so we have not yet used it in a demo.

For more information, see [the python page](https://github.com/twongCMU/AnomalyDetection/tree/twong/python/python)

Shortcomings of the Java code
 * Required 3rd party library that had to be manually installed (not in Maven repo)
 * Codebase grew organically due to unknown requirements
 * Codebase not well documented
 * No automated tests
 
Python port's improvements
 * Optionally uses a Docker container to deliver a pre-packaged running system with a single command
 * Codebase tries to reimplement the same external API as the Java code
   * The REST API is different but the interface with Essence follows the documented API
 * The Python code allows the same functionality in just 20% as much code
 * Codebase is better documented
 * Uses nosetest to verify functionality and confirm code coverage
 * Uses TeamCity to automatically run tests when repo changes
